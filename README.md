## Personal Website
This project is available live at, [iwanphillips.dev/](https://iwanphillips.dev/).

This project has been developed to be used as a showcase for my other personal project and to act as a dynamic portfoilio.

### Design

The application allows for the presentation of Projects, Experience, Skills and Social Links.

The application stores this information in a MySQL database that allows for storing relationships between these models.
These are then built live using Vue.js to recieve the information from the Laravel back-end.

Projects, Skills, Social Links, and Experience can be added to the site dynamically through the admin dashboard.
This is all achieved through dynamic forms that can add multiple skills and social to each project. 
Using a Single Page Application (SPA) design to create this dashboard.

### Learning

I took on this project to learn more about web front-end technologies like Vue.js and vanilla Javascript.
Having prior experience in Laravel from other projects, I used this framework as a base to then develop and expand further using Vue.js.

The project is currently being hosted using Google's Compute Engine, on an Ubuntu VM.
